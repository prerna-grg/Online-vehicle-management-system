GENERAL CODE DESCRIPTION :
--> my main function solves 3 purposes : 
	1) takes inputs from the user
	2) prints output in the console window
	3) makes appropriate function calls as per the functionality demanded by the user
	
--> list.h car.h bus.h truck.h have all the respective function declarations
--> my list.cpp contains entire function definitions that are applicable on my linked lists
--> car.cpp bus.cpp truck.cpp contain function definitions applicable on cars/trucks/buses

--> In case you give wrong inputs i.e if you enter string when asked for integer .. the program will terminate
